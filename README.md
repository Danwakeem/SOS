#Hey there,

This is an iPhone app that allows a user to save a location they might want to remember later. Imagine your self in a big parking lot and you don't remember where you parked. Well would't it be kind of cool if you could just flick down your notification center and click a button that says find my car and the app you opened has a map that tells you where to go to find your car? Well I thought it would be cool so I decided to start building this bad boy.

It should be easy to build but we will see. This it toally a work in progress so if you want to fork this project be prepaired it will be super ugly until I get all of the parts I want working working.

## Featured to be added.
*  Navigation
**  Drawing a route to your car.
** Today Extension
*  I think it will just be two buttons one that says find your car or save car location and another that says add location.
** Icon
*  I already know what I want I am just being lazy and haven't made it yet.
** Custom pins
*  Again I am just being lazy.
** Custom heading view
*  Not sure how I want these to look. I have an idea but still thinking.

I am hoping to finish this bad boy and upload it to the app store over christmas berak :)
